# AI-DLC and Spec-Driven Development

Kiro-style Spec Driven Development implementation on AI-DLC (AI Development Life Cycle)

## Project Memory

Project memory keeps persistent guidance (steering, specs notes, component docs) so Codex honors your standards each run. Treat it as the long-lived source of truth for patterns, conventions, and decisions.

- Use `.kiro/steering/` for project-wide policies: architecture principles, naming schemes, security constraints, tech stack decisions, api standards, etc.
- Use local `AGENTS.md` files for feature or library context (e.g. `src/lib/payments/AGENTS.md`): describe domain assumptions, API contracts, or testing conventions specific to that folder. Codex auto-loads these when working in the matching path.
- Specs notes stay with each spec (under `.kiro/specs/`) to guide specification-level workflows.

## Project Context

### Paths

- Steering: `.kiro/steering/`
- Specs: `.kiro/specs/`

### Steering vs Specification

**Steering** (`.kiro/steering/`) - Guide AI with project-wide rules and context
**Specs** (`.kiro/specs/`) - Formalize development process for individual features

### Active Specifications

- Check `.kiro/specs/` for active specifications
- Use `/prompts:kiro-spec-status [feature-name]` to check progress

## Development Guidelines

- Think in English, generate responses in Japanese. All Markdown content written to project files (e.g., requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md, research.md, validation reports) MUST be written in the target language configured for this specification (see spec.json.language).

## Minimal Workflow

- Phase 0 (optional): `/prompts:kiro-steering`, `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`
- Phase 1 (Specification):
  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-init "description"`
  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-requirements {feature}`
  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-gap {feature}` (optional: for existing codebase)
  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-design {feature} [-y]`
  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-design {feature}` (optional: design review)
  - `/prompts:kiro-spec-tasks {feature} [-y]`
- Phase 2 (Implementation): `/prompts:kiro-spec-impl {feature} [tasks]`
  - `/prompts:kiro-validate-impl {feature}` (optional: after implementation)
- Progress check: `/prompts:kiro-spec-status {feature}` (use anytime)

## Development Rules

- 3-phase approval workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- Human review required each phase; use `-y` only for intentional fast-track
- Keep steering current and verify alignment with `/prompts:kiro-spec-status`
- Follow the user's instructions precisely, and within that scope act autonomously: gather the necessary context and complete the requested work end-to-end in this run, asking questions only when essential information is missing or the instructions are critically ambiguous.

## Steering Configuration

- Load entire `.kiro/steering/` as project memory
- Default files: `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- Custom files are supported (managed via `/prompts:kiro-steering-custom`)

# Repository Guidelines

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- **General**: All code must pass `pre-commit` hooks (formatting, linting, type checking) before committing.
- **Backend (Python)**:
  - Use Python 3.12+ with strict type hints (`mypy`).
  - Follow `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes.
  - Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
- **Frontend (TypeScript)**:
  - Use TypeScript in strict mode—no `any` or `unknown`.
  - Use `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for hooks/functions/variables.
  - Use `biome` for linting and formatting.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add attendance summary API`); call out OpenAPI or schema changes explicitly in the body.

## Agent Workflow Notes

- Progress through `/kiro:spec-init`, `/kiro:spec-requirements`, `/kiro:spec-design`, and `/kiro:spec-tasks` sequentially; do not skip approval stages.
- Fetch current library documentation through Context7 prior to coding, then confirm assumptions inside the spec tasks.
- Conduct internal reasoning in English but deliver repository communications in Japanese, matching the project convention.
  When a shell command fails with “failed in sandbox”, use the permission request tool (with `with_escalated_permissions`) to ask the user for approval before retrying.

  ## TypeScript

- Only create an abstraction if it’s actually needed
- Prefer clear function/variable names over inline comments
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice
- Use `knip` to remove unused code if making large changes
- The `gh` CLI is installed, use it
- Don’t use emojis

## React

- Avoid massive JSX blocks and compose smaller components
- Colocate code that changes together
- Avoid `useEffect` unless absolutely needed

## Tailwind

- Mostly use built-in values, occasionally allow dynamic values, rarely globals
- Always use v4 + global CSS file format + shadcn/ui

## Next

- Prefer fetching data in RSC (page can still be static)
- Use next/font + next/script when applicable
- next/image above the fold should have `sync` / `eager` / use `priority` sparingly
- Be mindful of serialized prop size for RSC → child components

## TypeScript

- Don’t unnecessarily add `try`/`catch`
- Don’t cast to `any`
